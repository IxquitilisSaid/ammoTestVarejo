*INTRODUCTION TO THE CANDIDATE*

  Hello and good afternoon! My name is Jaime Oliveira. 
  Currently I'm a FrontEnd dev but I consider myself a passionate generalist (or FullStack, if you will).

  (What are my strong points) ->
    
    - Passionate about work, developing, learning new skills and teaching;
    - Self-taught;
    - Good work ethics;
    - Goal oriented;
    - Flexible regarding due dates and increases to production requirements;
    - Good verbal and written skills;
    - Keen on teamwork;
    - SCRUM adept;


  (What are my weak points) ->

    - Tend to "tunnle vision" on harder problems;
    - Too critical of my own work;
    - Inclination to try and help everyone or solve every problem;
    

  (What's my current stack) -> 
    
    - Python (
      - Django
    );
    - JavaScript (
      - Angular
      - React
      - ReactNative
      - Phaser
    );
    - PHP (
      - Joomla
      - WordPress
    );
    - Ruby (
      - Rails
    );


*INTRODUCTION TO THE CODE*

  (Thoughts on the purposed stack) ->

    I was thrilled by the combo of React and TypeScript!
    Since I have worked with Angular, two-way data binding seems always seems to be a pitfall of bad practices.
    React works with a one-way data binding flow, so mixing that with TypeScript's strong typed method, it's a match made in heaven!


  (Thought process) ->

    Recently I went to ReactCon and talking with some of the attendees, the buzzwords that was being thrown around (aside from Hooks) 
    was "Single Point of Truth". Basically trying to manage State and Conditional Rendering inside I file.
    Which leads me to how I built this app.

  
  (Component driven design) ->

    The bread and butter of React (or Angular). 
    While some best practices related to that approach may be "ignored" in smaller projects I believe that for AMMO, a large company,
    it's the best approach to build swappable, maintainable and reusable code.

  
  
*CLOSING STATEMENTS*

  I'm really grateful for this opportunity, though it was a short project, I did have a lot of fun building it.
  I look forward to our next meeting where, hopefully, I get to explain what I did and understand a bit more about the company's culture.

  Best regards,

  Jaime Oliveira
